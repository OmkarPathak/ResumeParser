# ResumeParser
A simple resume parser used for extracting information from resumes

# Installation

- For extracting text from various documents we use [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) and [docx2text](https://github.com/ankushshah89/python-docx2txt) modules. Install them using:

```bash
pip install pdfminer        # python 2
pip install pdfminer.six    # python 3
pip install docx2txt
```

- For NLP operations we use spacy and nltk. Install them using:

```bash
# spaCy
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# nltk
pip install nltk
python -m nltk nltk.download('words')
```

- For extracting other supporting dependencies, execute:

```bash
pip install -r resume_parser/requirements.txt

# and then execute
python resume_parser/pre_requisites.py
```

- Modify `resume_parser/resume_parser/skills.csv` as per your requirements

- Modify `Education Degrees` as per you requirements in [resume_parser/resume_parser/constants.py](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/ResumeParser/blob/master/constants.py)

- Place all the resumes that you want to parse in `resume_parser/resumes/` directory

- Run `resume_parser/resume_parser/resume_parser.py`

# Docker Installation

- For running the whole app in docker just run the following command fromm the root of the project

```bash
docker-compose up -d build
```

- Once all the installations are done, visit `0.0.0.0` in your broswer to use the app

# CLI

For running the resume extractor you can also use the `cli` provided

```bash
usage: cli.py [-h] [-f FILE] [-d DIRECTORY]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE                  resume file to be extracted
  -d DIRECTORY, --directory DIRECTORY   directory containing all the resumes to be extracted
```

For extracting data from a single resume file, use

```bash
python resume_parser/cli.py -f <resume_file_path>
```

For extracting data from several resumes, place them in a directory and then execute

```bash
python resume_parser/cli.py -d <resume_directory_path>
```

# GUI

- Django used
- Easy extraction and interpretation using GUI
- For running GUI execute:

```bash
python resume_parser/manage.py makemigrations
python resume_parser/manage.py migrate
python resume_parser/manage.py runserver
```

- Visit `127.0.0.1` to view the GUI

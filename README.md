# ResumeParser
A simple resume parser used for extracting information from resumes. Currently supports .doc .dox and .pdf.

# Installation

- For extracting text from various documents we use [pdfminer](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer) and [doc2text](https://github.com/ankushshah89/python-docx2txt) modules. Install them using:

```bash
pip install pdfminer        # python 2
pip install pdfminer.six    # python 3
pip install doc2text
```

- For NLP operations we use spacy and nltk. Install them using:

```bash
# spaCy
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# nltk
pip install nltk
python -m nltk nltk.download('words')
```

- Modify `skills.csv` as per your requirements

- Modify `Education Degrees` as per you requirements in [constants.py](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/ResumeParser/blob/master/constants.py)

- Place all the resumes that you want to parse in `resumes/` directory

- Run `resume_parser.py`

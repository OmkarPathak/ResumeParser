**Headline:** 🚀 Hiring just got Smarter: Introducing AI-Powered Candidate Comparison

**Body:**

Recruiters know the struggle: You have 5 great CVs. They all have Python, they all have 5 years of experience, and they all "led teams." usage. Who do you interview first? 🤔

Today, we pushed a major update to our **Resume Parser** that solves exactly this.

✨ **Introducing the AI Comparison Engine** ✨

Instead of manually tab-switching between PDFs, you can now:
1.  **Select** up to 5 candidates.
2.  **Click "Compare"**.
3.  **Get an Instant AI Verdict**.

💡 **What's under the hood?**
We built a custom `ComparisonAgent` powered by local LLMs that analyzes candidates side-by-side. It doesn't just match keywords; it understands context.

**The AI generates:**
*   🏆 **Top Choice Verdict**: A clear winner based on the job requirements.
*   📊 **Fit Scores**: Nuanced decimal ratings (e.g., 8.7/10) to separate the good from the great.
*   🧠 **Reasoning**: A "Why this candidate?" summary that explains the decision in plain English.
*   ⚖️ **Strengths & Weaknesses Matrix**: Deep-dive into what each candidate brings to the table.

**Why this matters?**
We are moving from "Search" to "Intelligence." It's not about finding *a* candidate anymore; it's about finding the *best* candidate, backed by data.
